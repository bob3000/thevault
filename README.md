# The Vault

The Vault is a command line file encryption tool. It performs symmetric AES
encryption using passwords. All cryptographic actions rely on libraries from the
[rust crypto](https://docs.rs/rust-crypto/0.2.36/crypto/) project.

## Features

- encrypt / decrypt a file inplace or to a different destination
- view encrypted file
- edit encrypted file
- read password from password file, environment variable, command line parameter
  or stdin

```sh
thevault-encrypt 0.1.0

USAGE:
    thevault encrypt [FLAGS] [OPTIONS]

FLAGS:
    -h, --help       Prints help information
    -i, --inplace
    -V, --version    Prints version information

OPTIONS:
    -f, --file <file>
    -o, --outfile <outfile>
    -p, --password <password>
    -w, --password-file <password-file>
```

## Installation

Currently the way to install The Vault is via Cargo. This might change in the
future when I found the time to do the packaging.

```sh
cargo install thevault
```

## Environment Variables

| variable name  | purpose                                           | default value |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------------------- | ------------- |
| `EDITOR`       | the text editor to be used when editing the vault | vim           |
| `PAGER`        | the pager to be used when viewing the vault       | less          |
| `THEVAULTPASS` | the password used to encrypt / decrypt the vault  | `None`        |

## Setting a password

When working with The Vault on a frequent basis it might become tedious to type
the same password over and over again. There are several ways available to provide
the password without repeatedly typing it.

### A vault password file

```sh
echo mysecretpassword > ~/.thevaultpass  # Caution: the password ends up in the shell history
chmod 600 ~/.thevaultpass
thevault encrypt -i -w ~/.thevaultpass myprivatefile.txt
thevault decrypt -i -w ~/.thevaultpass myprivatefile.txt
```

### An environment variable

```sh
export THEVAULTPASS=mysecretpassword  # Caution: the password ends up in the shell history
thevault encrypt -i myprivatefile.txt
thevault decrypt -i myprivatefile.txt
```

### Command line option

```sh
thevault encrypt -i -p mysecretpassword  myprivatefile.txt  # Caution: the password ends up in the shell history
thevault decrypt -i -p mysecretpassword  myprivatefile.txt  # Caution: the password ends up in the shell history
```

## Examples

### Read from _stdin_ and write to _stdout_

```sh
❯ cat <<END | thevault encrypt
Beautiful is better than ugly.
Explicit is better than implicit.
Simple is better than complex.
Complex is better than complicated.

### Encrypt a file inplace

```sh
❯ cat <<END > zen.aes

Explicit is better than implicit.
Simple is better than complex.
Complex is better than complicated.
END

❯ thevault encrypt -i -f zen.aes

### Decrypt a file to a different destination

```sh
